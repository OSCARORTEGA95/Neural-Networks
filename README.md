# Neural Network Models Repository

This repository contains three Python projects that demonstrate different neural network architectures and applications, each with a focused purpose:

---

## üìÅ Contents

1. **General Neural Network (Feedforward Model)**
   - A standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.
   - Used for supervised learning tasks such as regression or classification.
   - Includes training, evaluation, and basic visualization of metrics.

2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
   - An RNN model designed for sequential data.
   - Suitable for time series prediction, language modeling, or sequence classification.
   - Includes training loops and performance tracking.

3. **API-Integrated Project using NLP**
   - A complete pipeline that connects a machine learning model with a RESTful API.
   - Implements Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., tokenization, text embeddings).
   - Accepts user input via an API endpoint and returns predictions or processed results.
   - Ideal for showcasing model deployment or integrating ML into production workflows.
